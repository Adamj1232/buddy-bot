*   **Key Goal:** Provide a **safe**, engaging, and educational experience.
*   **Target Audience:** Children (ensure UI/UX and content are age-appropriate and safe).

**Development Focus:**

*   **Safety First:** Prioritize safety mechanisms, content filtering, and data privacy, especially concerning the LLM interaction (See `safety-considerations.mdc`).
*   **User Experience (UX):** Create an intuitive, visually appealing, and fun interface for children.
*   **Modularity:** Build reusable components for robot customization and interaction elements.
*   **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-documented (where necessary), and typed code adhering to the project's standards (See other rule files).
